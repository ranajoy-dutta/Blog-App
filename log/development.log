NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

ActionController::UnknownFormat (ArticlesController#index is missing a template for this request format and variant.

request.formats: ["text/html"]
request.variant: []

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

In a recent issue, the magazine’s Schumpeter columnist took aim at the rampant inflation of job titles in companies and governments around the world.\r\n\r\nThe winner, by a mile, was North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il, who, according to The Economist, has 1,200 official titles, “including roughly translated, guardian deity of the planet, ever-victorious general, and lodestar of the 21st century.” Memo to President Obama: “Leader of the Free World” seems downright lame compared with “supreme commander at the forefront of the struggle against imperialism and the United States” — not to mention my personal favorite, “greatest man who ever lived.”\r\n\r\nKim Jong Il can add King of Job-Title Inflation to his ever-increasing list of titles, but, according to The Economist, he’s just a world-class master of a worldwide phenomenon. CB Richard Ellis, the real-estate giant, has not one but four different CEOs. The c-suite in general is getting bigger and bigger, as Chief Information Officers welcome in Chief Knowledge Officers and (at Kodak) a Chief Listening Officer as well as (at SAP) a Chief Sustainability Officer. Even lower-ranking employees are getting loftier-sounding titles, from “sandwich artists” at Subway to cleaning companies who employ “sanitation consultants.”\r\n\r\nIt’s hard not to laugh along with the magazine — but it’s also possible to overlook the serious side of why it matters how people describe what they do and how organizations describe what gets done. Indeed, as I read the magazine column, I immediately thought back to the early days of Fast Company, and what was by far the most popular recurring feature in the magazine — two small nuggets in every issue that had the most passionate following of anything we published. The feature was called “Job Titles of the Future,” in which we found ordinary people doing real work with official titles that were decidedly out-of-the-ordinary.\r\n\r\nFor example, Ernst & Young, the accounting giant, employed a 20-something consultant in the role of Minister of Comedy. His job was to prepare videos and presentations for big client meetings that made the firm’s dry-as-dust work easier to swallow. One fast-growing telecom company chose to call the receptionist at headquarters its Director of First Impressions, to reinforce how seriously this tech-driven outfit was about the quality of its emotional and psychological to customers, suppliers. One videogame developer looked to its Chief Acceleration Officer to search for ways to slash development times and turn the organization into a, well, faster company.\r\n\r\nIt’s easy to make fun of these titles, but when we talked to the people who held them, you could feel their sense of ownership of, engagement with, and excitement about their jobs — and the offbeat titles that described their jobs. Their work truly mattered to them, and how their work got described to the world mattered as well.\r\n\r\nThat’s why I’m not quite so cynical about the proliferation of slightly offbeat (and even sometimes inflationary) job titles. People do their best work when they do work they love — which means it’s work that somehow connects with their unique skills, talents, and passions. Well, if the best jobs are the ones that aren’t cookie-cutter roles in plain-vanilla organizations, what’s wrong with breaking the mold when it comes to job titles? Would you rather be director of process improvement at a fast-growing software company, or, in the words of one job title of the future, Minster of Progress?\r\nA few years back, when I wrote Mavericks at Work, I spent a lot time at a fabulous company called Cranium, which designed and sold some of the most popular board games in history. This outfit was obsessed with how it designed its products and how its creative vocabulary and its values-based culture connected with customers. The acronym behind everything it did was CHIFF: Clever, High Quality, Innovative, Friendly, Fun. So it made sense that one of the most important leaders at the company held the title CHIFF Champion — her job was to make sure that every element of the product-design process embraced the CHIFF sensibility. Another critical title at the company was that of “Keeper of the Flame” — an executive who looked after the strategy and the culture to make sure that as Cranium grew, it remained true to the values on which its success was built.\r\n\r\nSo the next time you meet someone with a slightly offbeat job title, feel free to raise an eyebrow. But then take a moment to look deeper. Maybe that unique title does a good job of capturing something special about the company this person works for or the job he or she does. And think about your own title: Does it get the job done in terms of describing what you do and how you want to be known?\r\n\r\nIndeed, maybe it’s time to create your own Job Title of the Future. Just don’t go with “greatest man who ever lived.” I’m hoping to license North American rights from Kim Jung Il."}, "commit"=>"Publish"}

Another critical title at the company was that of “Keeper of the Flame” — an executive who looked after the strategy and the culture to make sure that as Cranium grew, it remained true to the values on which its success was built.\r\n\r\nSo the next time you meet someone with a slightly offbeat job title, feel free to raise an eyebrow. But then take a moment to look deeper. Maybe that unique title does a good job of capturing something special about the company this person works for or the job he or she does. And think about your own title: Does it get the job done in terms of describing what you do and how you want to be known?\r\n\r\nIndeed, maybe it’s time to create your own Job Title of the Future. Just don’t go with “greatest man who ever lived.” I’m hoping to license North American rights from Kim Jung Il."], ["created_at", "2019-04-30 17:30:14.180011"], ["updated_at", "2019-04-30 17:30:14.180011"], ["image_file_name", "adult-blank-businessman-326576.jpg"], ["image_content_type", "image/jpeg"], ["image_file_size", 39664], ["image_updated_at", "2019-04-30 17:30:13.188841"]]

Transforming business models, industries and whole economies before our eyes, for good or ill machine intelligence will leave no aspect of human existence untouched. As the very sober Future of Life Institute puts it on its website, “technology gives life the opportunity to flourish like never before … or self-destruct.” Yet while commentators agree on the magnitude of the phenomenon, they have internalized, and thus left out of their reckoning, another, more ominous, point of uniqueness: this is the first great wave of technological evolution that is being driven by managers in the grip of the ideology of shareholder primacy. That is, whose benefits are supposed to accrue to one constituency in society, irrespective of the externalities and where they fall.\r\n\r\nWhat a technology is used for is a choice. Combining the same digital tools with different management technology would yield different outcomes. It’s not hard to imagine peer-to-peer platforms devoted to medical or social ends, or an internet that by putting individuals in charge of their own data enables vendor relationship management rather than only customer relationship management. As Tom Davenport has argued, machine intelligence could – should – be used to augment humanity rather than replace it, with potential that neither could deliver on their own.\r\n\r\ns that likely under today’s incentives? Consider a quote from the founder of a food production start-up featured in Martin Ford’s Rise of the Robots: “Our device isn’t meant to make employees more efficient.

So more than ever we – and managers in particular – need to understand what it means to be what Peter Drucker in Post-Capitalist Society calls the “educated person” in the machine age: someone who lives in the digital present but inflects it by drawing on the accumulated great tradition of the past. That includes films like Invasion of the Bodysnatchers, which is thus a double tell-tale: so long as it still evokes a frisson, and we can recognize it as a warning – but only so long – we’ll know the fight to stay human is still there to be won.

Eighty percent of CEOs now believe the need for new skills is their biggest business challenge. For employees, research now shows that opportunities for development have become the second most important factor in workplace happiness (after the nature of the work itself). At the most fundamental level, we are a neotenic species, born with an instinct to learn throughout our lives. So it makes sense that at work we are constantly looking for ways to do things better; indeed, the growth-mindset movement is based on this human need. And whereas recruitment is an expensive, zero-sum game (if company A gets the star, company B does not), learning is a rising tide that lifts all boats.\r\n\r\nYet the urgency of work invariably trumps the luxury of learning. A study we recently ran with LinkedIn found that employees waste one third of their day on emails that have little or nothing to do with their jobs. The traditional corporate learning portal (the learning management system) is rarely used (other than for mandatory compliance training) and it often takes many clicks to find what you need. Learning therefore ends up being relegated — consciously and subconsciously — to the important-but-not-urgent quadrant of Eisenhower’s 2×2 matrix. On average, knowledge workers carve out just five minutes for formal learning each day. We’re all just too caught up in the inexorable flow of work.\r\n\r\nSo, the question becomes: How can we make learning part of the powerful current of the daily workflow? We believe there is a way, a new paradigm, which Josh coined “learning in the flow of work”.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhat exactly is the flow of work?\r\nEveryone’s experience at work differs of course, but there are some broad commonalities among knowledge workers: There are 780 million of them, and they sit in front of a computer for 6.5 hours every day. In particular, they spend 28% of their time on email, 19% of their time gathering information (searching for data), and 14% of their time communicating internally (in formal and informal meetings). Those three activities combined constitute 61% of the total time at work for this vast population.\r\n\r\nIt makes sense that knowledge workers should spend so much time absorbing and disseminating information. Finding data, facts, information, and insights, and then sharing it with others, is a daily activity for most of us. In fact, 38% of content that’s shared online is either educational or informational.\r\n\r\nLearning in the flow of work is a new idea: it recognizes that for learning to really happen, it must fit around and align itself to working days and working lives. Rather than think of corporate learning as a destination, it’s now becoming something that comes to us. Through good design thinkingand cutting-edge technology, we can build solutions and experiences that make learning almost invisible in our jobs. One could argue that Google and YouTube are two of the earliest “learning in the flow” platforms, which we now take for granted.\r\n\r\nSo, how can we use the flow of work to drive learning? We’ll first look at this from the perspective of the individual (bottom-up) and then from the perspective of the corporate (top-down)."}, "commit"=>"Publish"}

Eighty percent of CEOs now believe the need for new skills is their biggest business challenge. For employees, research now shows that opportunities for development have become the second most important factor in workplace happiness (after the nature of the work itself). At the most fundamental level, we are a neotenic species, born with an instinct to learn throughout our lives. So it makes sense that at work we are constantly looking for ways to do things better; indeed, the growth-mindset movement is based on this human need. And whereas recruitment is an expensive, zero-sum game (if company A gets the star, company B does not), learning is a rising tide that lifts all boats.\r\n\r\nYet the urgency of work invariably trumps the luxury of learning. A study we recently ran with LinkedIn found that employees waste one third of their day on emails that have little or nothing to do with their jobs. The traditional corporate learning portal (the learning management system) is rarely used (other than for mandatory compliance training) and it often takes many clicks to find what you need. Learning therefore ends up being relegated — consciously and subconsciously — to the important-but-not-urgent quadrant of Eisenhower’s 2×2 matrix. On average, knowledge workers carve out just five minutes for formal learning each day. We’re all just too caught up in the inexorable flow of work.\r\n\r\nSo, the question becomes: How can we make learning part of the powerful current of the daily workflow? We believe there is a way, a new paradigm, which Josh coined “learning in the flow of work”.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhat exactly is the flow of work?\r\nEveryone’s experience at work differs of course, but there are some broad commonalities among knowledge workers: There are 780 million of them, and they sit in front of a computer for 6.5 hours every day. In particular, they spend 28% of their time on email, 19% of their time gathering information (searching for data), and 14% of their time communicating internally (in formal and informal meetings). Those three activities combined constitute 61% of the total time at work for this vast population.\r\n\r\nIt makes sense that knowledge workers should spend so much time absorbing and disseminating information. Finding data, facts, information, and insights, and then sharing it with others, is a daily activity for most of us. In fact, 38% of content that’s shared online is either educational or informational.\r\n\r\nLearning in the flow of work is a new idea: it recognizes that for learning to really happen, it must fit around and align itself to working days and working lives. Rather than think of corporate learning as a destination, it’s now becoming something that comes to us. Through good design thinkingand cutting-edge technology, we can build solutions and experiences that make learning almost invisible in our jobs. One could argue that Google and YouTube are two of the earliest “learning in the flow” platforms, which we now take for granted.\r\n\r\nSo, how can we use the flow of work to drive learning? We’ll first look at this from the perspective of the individual (bottom-up) and then from the perspective of the corporate (top-down)."], ["created_at", "2019-04-30 18:33:38.743500"], ["updated_at", "2019-04-30 18:33:38.743500"], ["image_file_name", "design-learn-pattern-247819.jpg"], ["image_content_type", "image/jpeg"], ["image_file_size", 196993], ["image_updated_at", "2019-04-30 18:33:38.067238"]]
